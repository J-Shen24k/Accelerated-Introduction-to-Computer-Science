# Midterm Exam

You will have 100 minutes to complete this exam. You are not allowed to use any outside notes or resources and doing so will result in a zero on this exam. Make sure to read all the instructions for each question carefully and answer each question completely. Once you have finished, please commit and push you work to your repository. Please confirm that the code is in your remote repository, i.e. that it is on bitbucket.org.

## Question One: Selection

Write a Java program that will prompt the user for an integer. If the integer is even, print out "foo". If the integer is odd, print out "bar".

## Question Two: Repetition

Write a Java program that will prompt the user for a number and print out a square with those dimensions. For example, if a user enters 5, return the following:

```
* * * * *
* * * * *
* * * * *
* * * * *
* * * * *
```

## Question Three: Arrays

Write a Java program that will prompt the user for 10 integers, stores them in an array, and then, using the array, returns the maximum integer entered.

**NOTE:** Do not sort the array or use ArrayLists.

## Question Four: Objects

Write a Java class based on the following UML diagram. Include all standard methods, such as constructors, mutators, accessors, toString, and equals. Additionally, implement any methods shown in the diagram.

**NOTES:**

- Please make sure that the rectangle's length and width are positive.
- area = length x width
- perimeter = 2.0 x (length + width)
